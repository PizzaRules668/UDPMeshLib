All communication is done big endian for GUID and Int types

Header format:
XXXXGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGYYYY[payload]
XXXX: UDPM, magic token
GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG: GUID, 16 byte client identifier
YYYY: Int32, type identifier

Using negative types for plugin communication/mesh generation, positive types are for applications use
Payloads:

===Server->Client===

--Type: -1 Inform client of endpoints
[GUID]...
This packet is just the list of GUID's repeated that a connected to the server, read till end of bytes.

Type: -2 Client endpoint information
GUID,IPV4Number [IPV4 IPV4PORT]... IPv6Number [IPV6 IPV6Port]....

GUID: A mesh members client GUID
IPV4Number: unsigned byte - number of ipv4 endpoints to read.
IPV4: The 4 address bytes
IPV4PORT: The 2 port bytes

IPV4 endpoints are repeated

IPv6Number: unsigned byte - number of ipv6 endpoints to read
IPv6: The 16 address bytes
IPv6PORT: The 2 port bytes

-3: Relay to client
[Payload]
Payload: The encapsulated message to deliver


===Client->Server===
--Type: -101 Announce local addresses and presence to server

Format:
IPV4Number [IPV4 IPV4PORT]... IPv6Number [IPV6 IPV6Port]....

IPV4Number: unsigned byte - number of ipv4 endpoints to read.
IPV4: The 4 address bytes
IPV4PORT: The 2 port bytes

IPV4 endpoints are repeated

IPv6Number: unsigned byte - number of ipv6 endpoints to read
IPv6: The 16 address bytes
IPv6PORT: The 2 port bytes

IPV6 endpoints are repeated

--Type: -102 Relay through the server to another client
GUID Payload
Guid: Destination GUID
Payload: The encapsulated message to deliver

--Type: 103 Inform server of others heartbeat
GUID TYPE ENDPOINT
GUID Receiving client
Type(byte): 4 IPv4, 6: IPv6
ENDPOINT: The 4 or 16 bytes for the address, followed by the 2 bytes for the port number.


===Client->Client===
--Type: -201 - Heartbeat packets, these do the hole punching and helps clients maintain the mesh network state.
SENDTIME
SENDTIME: The current time
--Type: -202 - Heartbeat response - These allow the latency and clockdifference measurements
RECEIVETIME SENDTIME
ReceiveTime: The time received in -201 type messages.
Sendtime: The current time
